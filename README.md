# 2D to 3D Conversion Project

This project focuses on converting 2D images into 3D rendered meshes using depth estimation techniques. The primary goal is to generate a 3D point cloud and mesh from a single 2D image, leveraging depth maps as an intermediate step.

## Overview

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **[MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS):** A state-of-the-art deep learning model for monocular depth estimation. MiDaS is used to generate depth maps from 2D images.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Open3D:** For 3D visualization and mesh generation from point clouds.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing depth maps and other intermediate outputs.

The pipeline involves:
1. Generating a depth map from a 2D image using MiDaS.
2. Converting the depth map into a 3D point cloud.
3. Rendering the point cloud into a 3D mesh.

## System details

Multipass with 8 CPU cores and 12 GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.02 LTS  

## Current Status

The pipeline successfully generates depth maps and point clouds, but the resulting 3D meshes require further refinement. As a next step, I am exploring **[TriPoS-R](https://github.com/your-link-to-triposr)**, a tool designed for high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies, such as MiDaS, Open3D, and Matplotlib.

## Usage

1. Place your input 2D image in the `input/` directory.
2. Run the script `depth_to_pointcloud.py` to generate the depth map, point cloud, and 3D mesh:
   ```bash
   python depth_to_pointcloud.py
   ```
3. The outputs will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Results

### Original Input
*(input.jpg)*

### Input Depth Map
*(depth_map.png)*

### Output Point Cloud
This point cloud renders better than the final output. To its justice, this is of size 40MB and final output if 600KB.

### Output 3D Mesh

## Next Steps

The current implementation works but has limitations in mesh quality. To address this, I am integrating **TriPoS-R** for improved 3D mesh reconstruction. Stay tuned for updates!
